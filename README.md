## Description
* This is a Final Capstone project that I meant to assess my understanding of the various programming paradigms in the Python language
as a software engineer. It is meant to help me use all that I have been taught in the HyperionDev Bootcamp so that I can showcase to employers that I am ready to be hired.

* In this project, I will use lists or dictionaries and functions to extend the functionality of a simple task management system. This is a program designed for a small business to help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of a team. This project aims to assess my ability to refactor code. Refactoring code is done to reduce code complexity and ensure the readability of a teamâ€™s functioning code so that other developers will not struggle to decipher the code.
* A key focus of this project will be ensuring that the code is correct, well-formatted, and readable.

## Installation
* This project does not require any traditional form of installation, just git clone this repository and run the task_manager.py file by pressing F5 on any Python editor such as VS code and the like and you will see the output of the program.

## Usage
* This Python application is used to create new users assign tasks to users, assign them a due date of completion of tasks, and mark tasks as completed or not. It also helps in generating user task reports.

## Credits
This project is developed by a sole developer through the help of Hyperion lecturers and mentors. To them, I give them credit for their time.
