# FinalCapstone
## Description
This is a Final Capstone project that I meant to assess my understanding of the various programming paradigms in the Python language
as a software engineer. It is meant to help me use all that I have been taught in the HyperionDev Bootcamp so that I can showcase to employers that I am ready to be hired.
In this project, I will use lists or dictionaries and functions to extend the functionality of a simple task management system. This is a program designed for a small business to help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of a team. This project aims to assess my ability to refactor code. Refactoring code is done to reduce code complexity and ensure the readability of a teamâ€™s functioning code so that other developers will not struggle to decipher the code.
A key focus of this project will be ensuring that the code is correct, well-formatted, and readable.
