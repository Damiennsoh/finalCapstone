# FinalCapstone
## Description
In this project, I will use lists or dictionaries and functions to extend the functionality of a simple task management system. This is a program designed for a small business to help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of a team. This project aims to assess my ability to refactor code. Refactoring code is done to reduce code complexity and ensure the readability of a teamâ€™s functioning code so that other developers will not struggle to decipher the code.
A key focus of this project will be ensuring that the code is correct, well-formatted, and readable.
